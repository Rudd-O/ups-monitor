* icon does not look good in gnome panel

* put hide in panel button on the main interface

* Figure out why calling request_save while on a KDE session, all
  GNOME apps hang.

* make process GNOME cmdline args

* rewrite autodetection code to connect to local host instead of reading
/etc/ups/ups.conf
(seems to work mostly nowadays, though)

* full session management support
- if multiple apps are running, save their UPS address/username/password and reload upon restart, instead of blindly reloading .upsmonitor.conf

* event log window?

* move to GtkHeaders instead of GtkLabels?  How, with Glade?

* i18n/l10n

* use the true Description field (if available) everywhere the ups name is being used in the UI

* untangle the mess and refactor code
- put classes in unique files

* make main window titlebar more descriptive


Usability issues:

Double-click or Space key should perform the icon's default action.
Normally this should open a window with relevant data, for example: 

  (make ups monitor tray icon show icon on space)

Right-click or Shift-F10 should present a menu for the icon containing at
least the icon's default action.

Alerts must stay above their parent. Alerts do not appear in the system window list.
Consequently, take care to ensure that alerts stay above their parent window.
Otherwise, users will be likely to lose the alert and find your application unresponsive
for no apparent reason. Modal windows should always stay above the window(s) they block.

(con window .present si los dialogs estan visibles?, aparecen en el system window list?)
