* rewrite autodetection code to connect to local host instead of reading
/etc/ups/ups.conf

* find out whether the UPS is a master for the current machine, so as to avoid unnecessary session saves

* session management support
- remember last UPSes monitored, with credential information
- if multiple apps are running, save their UPS address/username/password and reload upon restart, instead of blindly reloading .upsmonitor.conf

* event log window?

* move to GtkHeaders instead of GtkLabels?  How, with Glade?

* gnome support?  #ifdef'd ?

* i18n/l10n

* use the true Description field (if available) everywhere the ups name is being used in the UI

* untangle the mess and refactor code
- put classes in unique files

* use sys.path construct (augmenting it at runtime to find the UPS monitor share directory), to load images and all shared information

* make main window titlebar more descriptive

* auto-toolize?

* make exceptions show in own window instead of standard error

* find a more portable way (ideally, in Python) to do tray icons than eggtrayiconmodule.so
