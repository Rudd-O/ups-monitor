Congratulations!  You just got ahold of one of my open source products.
UPS monitor is a simple tool that displays UPS information in real time.
It can monitor a UPS attached to your computer, or a a network server
plugged into an UPS.


Features:
- Saves your session if UPS switches to battery power
- Warns you when power is critically low
- Lets you monitor networked UPSes
- Remembers configuration and restarts when you log on
- Extremely easy to use
- Unobtrusive display as a tray icon


This software requires:
- an UPS
- the Network UPS Tools server, configured and running
- Python
- the Python GTK+ 2 bindings, and Glade bindings


To install this software:

Type './configure && make install' while on the command line.  You will probably
need administrative privileges to perform a system-wide installation.  Check
the standard configure options (--help) to install in other directories.

(using the provided RPM packages is much easier, trust me!)
