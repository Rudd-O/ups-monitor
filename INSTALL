Installation of UPS monitor is quite simple.

If you prefer to perform a source install, just run in the source directory:

  test -f configure || ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --prefix=/the/desired/base/path
  make install

That's it.

RPM-based installs can be much more gratifying, though.
Simply get the RPM and install it, or build the rpm
by issuing

  ./configure
  make rpm

then install the RPM.  That's it!
